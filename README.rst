Pyramid GeoREST interface
=========================

pyramid_georest is a open source plugin for the pyramid web framework. It provides access to geographical
and (also non geographical) database sources via a restful API.

Are you tired of writing code to get some data out of a database to use it in some web client?

Wouldn't it be a good idea to handle geodata and 'normal' data in one API?

Well... Then probably this library is exactly what you are looking for.

Its **easy to install**, **easy to setup** and **easy to extend**.

To learn more about this project and its abilities please refer to the detailed [documentation](https://vvmruder.github.io/pyramid_georest 'documentation').
